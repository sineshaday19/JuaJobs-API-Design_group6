## Executive Summary of Key Design Decisions

### 1. Architecture

- **RESTful API:** Clean and resource-oriented URLs following REST principles.
- **Modular Design:** Endpoints are grouped logically (e.g., `/jobs`, `/workers`, `/applications`) for easier management.
- **OpenAPI Spec:** The API is documented using OpenAPI for clarity and integration ease.

### 2. Security

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Access levels are defined for admins, employers, and workers.
- **Input Validation:** All inputs are validated to prevent invalid or harmful data.

### 3. Data Management

- **MongoDB:** Primary data store for job posts, profiles, applications, and messages.
- **Schema Definitions:** Each resource has a well-defined schema with required fields.

### 4. API Design

- **Consistent Structure:** Standard CRUD endpoints for resources like jobs, workers, and applications.
- **Filtering:** Jobs can be filtered by category, location, and budget.
- **Pagination:** List endpoints are paginated to improve performance.

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **Lightweight Responses:** Endpoints return only essential data.
- **Simple Caching:** Frequently accessed jobs can be cached.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Focus on speed and clarity in the API.

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** for document-based data storage

### Frontend
